# Software stack

This experiment was also an exercise in developing an reproducible, open-source
workflow.

## FluidLab: a generic API for laboratory devices

## FluidCoriolis: utilities for calibrating and conducting experiments

## FluidImage: a scalable image processing framework

* matlab frameworks, dantec / lavision
* libre: no license issue to run on HPC clusters
* asynchronous processing: massive parallelization
* single tooling for entire post-experiment workflow: calibration,
  preprocessing, PIV, postprocessing of velocity fields
* limitations: algorithms
