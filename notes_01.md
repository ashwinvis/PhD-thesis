The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is a global circuit of ocean
currents spanning all ocean basins in depth and breadth.
This circulation is responsible for the bulk of heat transport from the equator
to the poles across the globe. Without this global conveyor belt, shown in
@fig:thermohaline-global, the temperatures at latitudes away from the equator
would be considerably lesser [@bryden_slowing_2005]. It is also responsible for
replenishing the surface water with nutrients and critical to the sustenance of
marine life.

circulation (AMOC) in depth and latitude coordinates. The dashed lines represent
streamlines of overturning masses, the Antarctic bottom water (AABW) and the
North Atlantic deep water (NADW), the black solid lines are the isopycnals and
the red arrow represents the downward diapycnal heat flux due to mixing. (Â©

The MOC was also known as the thermohaline circulation, due to the misconception
that heat and salinity fluxes due to melting of ice near the polar region and
evaporation elsewhere as shown in @fig:thermohaline-global.
Today, the MOC is thought to be driven by a combination of wind forcing,
changes in buoyancy and diapycnal mixing, as shown in @fig:moc, a simplified
sketch of the Atlantic MOC. The
exact contribution of these three forces remain an open question
[see chapter
21 in @vallis_atmospheric_2017].
It should be noted that the circulation happens within a ocean with varying
degrees of stable stratification in both temperature and salinity. For
illustrating this the time averaged temperature
and salinity in the Atlantic ocean [calculated from @carton_soda3_2018] are
plotted in @fig:atlantic-salt-temp. It is understood that through mixing,
kinetic energy is converted into available potential energy which allows the
streamlines to overturn and thus allowing bottom water from great depths to
resurface.

In the strongly stratified regime, mixing coefficient values have been found to
be in the range, $\Gamma \in [0.26, 0.51]$
[@BrethouwerLindborg2009;@maffioli_mixing_2016], thus significantly larger than
the canonical value of $\Gamma = 0.2$. In @maffioli_mixing_2016, high
resolution DNS of Boussinesq equation suggested that the mixing coefficient
peaks at an intermediate $Fr \approx 0.29$ with $\Gamma \approx 0.51$ and then
for stronger stratifications a declining trend up to $Fr \approx 0.02$ with
$\Gamma \approx 0.33$ was recorded. Also note that, as shown in
@fig:stratified-regime, oceans measurements are considerably more stratified
[@gargett_composite_1981].

The question of what value the mixing coefficient would tend to at higher
levels of stratification, is at the heart of the project titled Mixing and
Length Scales in Stratified Turbulence (MILESTONE) [@ISSF2016].
