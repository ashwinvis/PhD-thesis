And so we reach the end of this part of the thesis. I hope you, anonymous
reader from the future, had some fun reading the overview and thank you for
reading it so far.

As a supervisor, Dr. Erik Lindborg championed this work into reality. It would
not be an understatement to say that he was one of the kindest and most
understanding mentors that I ever had. I still remember it like yesterday when
he entrusted me with this position, with no prior acquaintance. His insight
into technical details while working on the theoretical aspects of research,
patience, willingness to adapt with situation and drive for perfection has
left a lasting impression on me. I shall be eternally grateful for the
countless lessons that I learned -- both scientific and philosophical.

I am also thankful to my co-supervisor Dr. Pierre Augier, who was approachable
as a colleague despite being several kilometres away. His passion for
open-science and design philosophies has opened up a brave new world of
possibilities for me and others when it comes to research. Personally, I am
grateful for letting me discover this niche domain which combines two of my
favourite interests -- fluid mechanics and programming -- and later on, sharing
responsibilities.

Thanks to Dr. Antoine Campagne, Dr. Andrea Maffioli and Dr. Antonio Segalini
for sharing your knowledge while working together. Special thanks to Dr.
Anders Dahlkild for reviewing this thesis and sharing his valuable feedback.

A few words of gratitude to all my teachers -- from KTH, Stockholm University,
IIT Kanpur, CET, Nava Nirman and Sivagiri Vidyaniketan -- what they have taught
me provided the foundation for this work and instilled the spirit of enquiry in
me. \emph{I think therefore, I am}.

This journey lasting five years has become all the more memorable with quality
time shared with friends in KTH, LEGI, Stockholm University and around
Stockholm. The long walks, bike rides, barbecues, conversations over fika,
lunches and dinners, cultural events, hangouts, and the occasional nerd talk
will be cherished in the years to come. I also appreciate the advices and
wake-up calls that some of you selflessly gave me. A shout out to my friends
from yesteryears -- those phone calls, messages and meet-ups have kept my
memories fresh of the good times we had. To all, I wish the best of fortunes
and may our paths cross again.

None of this would have happened if it were not for the tremendous support I
received from Neelu and Ameya together with whom I started on this pursuit of
happiness alongside this pursuit for knowledge. With them it became
straightforward to take my mind off work. I thank you both for
being understanding and staying close.

Finally, thanks to \emph{Achen} for satisfying my curiosity as a child and
for all the care sent this way while I was away. Thanks to \emph{Amma} whose
words have stayed a constant guiding light. Thanks to Asha \emph{chechi} for
being awesome and finding time for everyone. Thanks to Kalyan \emph{chettan}
whose words of wisdom has been only limited by time and space. Thank you for
all being patient and supportive, if only I can make up for all the lost time.
