In the right plot of
@fig:shallow-toy, the divergence field consists of ripples of alternative
positive and negative values, indicating that simulation results in gravity
waves and not shocks.

![Average shock separation distance $(d)$ in a series of shallow water
simulations plotted against the forcing Froude number $(F_f)$. The Froude
number is inversely proportional to the wave phase-speed, $c$. The theoretical
prediction $d \propto F_f^{1/2}$ is displayed as a dashed line.  Source:

A comparison of the spectral energy budgets from a GCM simulation
[@AugierLindborg2013] and a toy model simulation [@LindborgMohanan2017]. The
total spectral energy flux $\Pi$ has been decomposed into kinetic ($\Pi_K$) and
available potential energy ($\Pi_A$) energy fluxes. The conversion from
available potential energy to kinetic energy is represented by $C_{cum}$. The
kinetic energy flux is further decomposed as $\Pi_{2D}$, the flux due to
geostrophic modes and the difference $\Pi_K - \Pi_{2D}$.
