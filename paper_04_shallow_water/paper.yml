  The dynamics of irrotational shallow water wave turbulence forced in large
  scales and dissipated at small scales is investigated. First, we derive the
  shallow water analogue of the `four-fifths law' of Kolmogorov turbulence
  for a third order structure function involving velocity and displacement
  increments. Using this relation and assuming that the flow is dominated by
  shocks we develop a simple model predicting that the shock amplitude scales as
  $ (\epsilon d)^{1/3} $, where $ \epsilon $ is the mean dissipation rate and $ d $
  the mean distance between the shocks, and that the $ p $:th order displacement
  and velocity structure functions scale as $ (\epsilon d)^{p/3} r/d $, where $ r $
  is the separation. Then we carry out a series of forced simulations with
  resolutions up to $7680^2$, varying the Froude number, $F_{f} = (\epsilon L_f)^{1/3}/
  c $, where $ L_f $ is the forcing length scale  and $c$ is the wave
  speed. In all simulations a stationary state is reached in which there is a
  constant spectral energy flux and equipartition between kinetic and potential
  energy in the constant flux range. The third order structure function relation
  is satisfied with a high degree of accuracy. Mean energy is found to scale
  approximately as $
  E \sim \sqrt{\epsilon  L_f  c} $, and is also dependent on resolution, indicating
  that shallow water wave turbulence does not fit into the paradigm of a
  Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade. In all simulations shocks develop, displayed as
  long thin bands of negative divergence in flow visualisations. The mean
  distance between the shocks is found to scale as $ d \sim F_f^{1/2} L_f $.
  Structure functions of second and higher order are found to scale in good
  agreement with the model. We conclude that in the weak limit, $ F_f \rightarrow
  0 $, shocks will become denser and weaker and finally disappear for a finite
  Reynolds number. On the other hand, for a given $ F_{f} $, no matter how small,
  shocks will prevail if the Reynolds number is sufficiently large.
