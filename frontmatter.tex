\begin{preface}
    This thesis contains numerical, theoretical, experimental and
    technical studies aiming at advancing the understanding of stratified flows.
    Studies which motivated this thesis, along with theoretical
    details and research highlights of the present work are summarized in the
    first part. The second part contains five articles and one conference
    paper.
    The papers are adjusted to comply with the present thesis format for
    consistency, but their contents have not been altered as compared with their
    original counterparts.

	\paperitem
        The code was developed by PA and Ashwin Vishnu
        Mohanan (AVM). The simulations and post-processing were performed
        by AVM. The theory was developed by PA and EL with input from AVM. A
        first version of the paper was written by PA. The final version was
        written by EL with input from AVM.

        The experiment was planned by the group from KTH together with the group from
        LEGI. The experimental set-up was put together by
        the group from LEGI. The experiment was carried out by the two groups
        together.
        The code for image-processing was developed by AVM, PA, Antoine
        Campagne (AC), Joel Sommeria (JS) and the code for processing
        probe data was developed by PA, R\'emi Chassagne and Diane Micard. The
        post-processing was performed by AVM, PA, AC, AS and JS.
        The paper was written by AC with input from PA, EL and AVM.
